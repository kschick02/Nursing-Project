In order to run this project, make sure to run "composer install" once you're in the correct directory.
Also, you'll need to create a database (I called mine order_system), set up your .env.example file with proper database name, username, and password, and this APP_KEY: base64:P4jqRC8lzYpU8A8kV5kD/mnIim46FymUUabA0w5bHrE=   (and save that file as .env).
Then run: php artisan migrate

Also, to get the admin authentication to work, you will need to add an admin column to your users table like so:
ALTER TABLE users add admin boolean;
Then, to set an admin,
UPDATE users set admin = 1 where id = [the id of the user you want to be an admin];

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
